# Multi_server-file-downloader
A file downloader system that downloads a large video from multiple servers and then combines them at the client to produce the original video.
To run this code, you're gonna have to put the fileprocessing.py file in each of the 4 servers and the client as well.
Download a 20MB video from the internet to your local drive and upload that in the code.
